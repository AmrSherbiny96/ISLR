This repository contains my solutions for the excercises in the book An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James, G.M., Witten, D.M., Hastie, T.J., & Tibshirani, R. The excercises are implemented in python, and are not meant to be used reference but a way for me to practice and hopefully help someone who might be interested as well. I don't go through the excercises in the exact order, and may deviate a little bit to practice a topic I think I need to.
